            <p>
                Crono (クロノ, Kurono) is the red spiky-haired silent protagonist of the game. He is never shown speaking, using facial expressions to communicate. He lives in the village of Truce with his mother. A chance encounter with Marle at the fair begins a series of adventures and uncovers a pre-millennial evil. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Crono uses a katana as a weapon and learns to use "Light" magic. Most of the game's triple techs require his presence in the battle party if they are to be performed. Though there are triple techs that do not need him, certain accessories are required to use triple techs where he is not involved.

            <p>
                Lucca (ルッカ, Rukka) is Crono's childhood friend. Using her intelligence and creativity, Lucca invented many devices, such as a battle-training robot named Gato and a short-range teleporter. This device caused Marle to go back in time, inevitably leading to the start of the game. Lucca is directly responsible for the playability of another character in the game - Robo, whom she finds and repairs in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lucca battles with a gun and hammer, and when spells become available she learns to cast "Fire" magic.

            <p>
                Marle (Marl (マール, Māru)), is the princess of Guardia. He is never shown speaking, using facial expressions to communicate. She is often at odds with her father, the king. Bored of royal life in the castle, she slips out to the Millennial Fair in Truce. Here, she meets Crono and tries out Lucca's teleporter, which reacts with her pendant and creates a time Gate, sending her to the Middle Ages and kicking off the events of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marle uses a crossbow as her weapon. When she gains the ability to use magic, she learns to use "Ice (Water)" elemental magic manifesting as ice and healing spells.

After witnessing Cyrus' death at the hands of Magus and being transformed into a frog, Frog vowed to avenge Cyrus by killing Magus.
            </p>

                Frog wields a broadsword and can also learn "Water" and, like Marle, healing magic.

                Robo (ロボ, Robo) is a futuristic robot with serial number R-66Y. He was rendered dormant by the apocalypse in AD 1999 but is found and repaired by Lucca in the year AD 2300. Upon his reactivation, Robo has no memory of his prior mission and joins the party.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robo uses his robotic arm as a weapon and can use laser attacks which mimic "Shadow" magic, as well as other techs that mimic "Fire" and "Light" skills. He is considered unable to use magic because he is not organic, and therefore did not descend from the magic-using people of Zeal.

                <code>In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Robo a 32 out of 40. Destructoid's Chad Concelmo named Robo the best robot in gaming, citing an ongoing connection with the character.</code>
